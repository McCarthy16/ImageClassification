# ImageClassification

Uses a neural network to classify and recreate images from two different datasets, MNIST and FMNIST.

MNIST: a public dataset containing digits from 0-9

FMNIST: a public dataset containing fashion items

The neural network uses autoencoder architecture.

The program was written and ran in google collab using pytorch.
